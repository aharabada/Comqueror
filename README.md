# Comqueror
Comqueror is a monitor software that can send and receive data over the serial port.

Have you ever wanted to log and examine the data that two devices exchange via the serial interface? Me neither, Comqueror can do it anyway.

## Features
- Send and receive data via the serial port
- Open two serial connections simultaneously and forward data from one to the other

- Bugs and Crashes
